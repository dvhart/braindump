PyDo is a Metadata based Todo and Note taking application.  It attempts to
work as you.. ok I.. do.  It provides categories to allow you to filter
your view of todo items and notes so that you can work with a related
subset at a time.  It also allows for a hierarchical structure, linking
items to eachother.  It is designed to be flexible enough to meet the 
organizational needs of most technical professionals.

With categories you can divide items by project, team, line item, etc.

Item types:
    notes    - simple text, date
    Todo     - text with a completion check box, time spent, date
    Process  - text with a percentage completion and start/due/end dates, time spent, date

class item {
    date
    text
    list categories
    item* parent
}

class todo {
    public item
    float complete (used as toggle)
    time_spent (hours or days?)
    ready (can this be done now? maybe just a pointer to a list of dependent tasks?)
}

class process {
    public todo (complete used as percentage)
    start_date
    end_date
    due_date
}
