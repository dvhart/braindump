NOTE: If you are reading this version of the code, it means you have probably
expressed an interest in the forming of the project and it's fundamental
design, rather than strictly in using the end-result.  As such, please keep in
mind that this project is "not intelligent design" but rather an evolutionary
code base.  I am using this project to learn best python practices, and as such
the object hierarchy and other fundamental design elements are likely (read:
will) change, probably drastically.  That said, the end goal is to produce a
top notch python gnome application.  Constructive criticism about any aspect of
the project is very welcome.

Thanks,

BrainDump is a Context based Todo and Note taking application, based largely on
the productivity tips outlined in the book "Getting Things Done" by David
Allen.  Tasks are tagged with the context in which you plan to accomplish them
(Phone Calls, Evening, Online, Weekends, etc.).

Tasks are the leaf node of a tree like hierarchy:

Realm (Personal, Profesional, etc.)
   |-Area of Responsibility (Staff Development, Technical Leadership, Parenting)
       |-Project
           |-Task

Realms allow you to filter your view of todo items and notes so that you can
work with a related subset at a time.  The Area and Project levels are used
during the Weekly Review process to ensure you are making progress on each of
your responsibilities.

The user interface is designed to optimize the common cases, which I believe to
be viewing and checking off tasks, and populating new projects and tasks during
weekly reviews.  As such, those tasks can be accomplished without the use of
dialog boxes, excessive mouse clicks, etc.  I intend to make the app save state
automatically - so there will be no "Save" or "Save As" symmantics, just an
"Open" to work with a different data file.
