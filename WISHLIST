<nacc_home> dvhart_: i've got another feature request for your todo/calendar -- a "deadline" feature, such that I can say this todo entry is due in 3 weeks and will get calendar entries for each week between now and then with a reminder (2 weeks left, 1 week left, etc) -- the reminder separation (daily (for howeworks), weekly (for longer assignments) or monthly (status reports)) would be selectable, as would be the reminder option period

<cconacher> create tickler() from task

Tools/Extras:
    - Generate Status report
    - Searchable
    - Insert Date
    - Typeahead maybe?

UI
    - similar to f-spot
    - check some categories, or click "All"

Components
    pydo module
        decide on storage model (xml, pickle, plain text ??)
    curses ui
    pyglade ui
