o consider keeping all state in the tree:
    o filtered tasks
    o visible realms (done, not in list form...)
    o filterlist
o if state is all in the tree, then widgets just have to connect
  to the right piece of the tree for a datamodel
o widgets only change the datamodel, the datamodel updates all relevant
  widgets
    o this may involve intermediate gtk.TreeModels...
o consider adding a task_filter_func() to the get_tasks() calls in gtd.* objects
    o this will apply the filter inline with the original recursive array
      generation, saving multiple O(N) operations, or hard coded loops
