This is HORRIBLY incomplete.  The list is immense as the project isn't
even completely functional yet.  Right now I just start the app, pick some
unimplemented bit, and hack away...  I'll update this file to remind me
of things I can't just as easily do via inline '# FIXME's

Basic Functionality
o Recursive delete option
  - recurse =false is used by default now and delete is disabled for the
    objects with paren't in the None Path
  - need a dialog to confirm recursive delete (may be a new menu item so
    "delete" never needs a dialog)
o Determine how to deal with "Waiting" tasks, perhaps a delegated field?
o fix about dialog name "braindump.py" to "BrainDump", glade shows "BrainDump
  1.0", not sure what's going on the about dialog's widget->name seems to be
  "braindump.py" ???
o recalculate sizing for context table after context renaming
o decide what to do about left side of the window.  Lining up with the menu
  indents everything a bit too much
o consider implementing a date/time widget like (gnome-date-entry sucks goats): 
  http://www.mail-archive.com/pygtk@daa.com.au/msg12160.html
o replace the task filter strings with task filter by store objects, one for
  contexts and one for projects, each one telling the filter_by_selection box
  which model to use
o redesign the broken-ass gtd-popup-menu for right-button-press on all the tree
  views...
o when changing the filtered list of tasks or projects, if the previously
  selected gtd object is still visible, it should be selected.
o add a "[ ] include details" checkbox for the searches
o Update area_selection model on realm_visible changes
o norelief combo box: http://code.google.com/p/pychess/source/browse/trunk/lib/pychess/widgets/ToggleComboBox.py?r=978 
o stacked sidebar

Packaging
o Debian/Ubuntu
o RedHat/Suse

Artwork
o Need a profesisonal icon

Improvements
o have the filter row animate (swell, glow, whatever) when something is
  added/removed
o consider using a treeview for tasks, and break them up into "Today"
  "Tomorrow"|"This Week" "Later/No Date"
o task and project resource attachments (with twisty to hide)
o recurring tasks
o create plugin mechanism
o consider making contexts two one or more realms (So when you turn off the
  work realm, all the work only contexts go away, some contexts will belong to
  multiple realms)
o MetaFilters - allow the creation of project and task filters by the user
  using boolean logic: "Calls and Morning", "Evening or Weekend"
o consider making rename less easy - can be done on accident
o nag mail for delegated tasks
o export to html
o report generation (monthly reports, burn-down, etc.)
o consider multiple notes per task/project, automatically dated, removed with a single click on an [x]...
o consider using a dict of fields.  This would make writing plugins easier,
  and the backing stores simpler.
  - could also just use the method described here: 
    http://www.python.org/doc/2.2/ref/attribute-access.html
o consider storing realm.visible in the backing store to easily open up in the
  same state...
o grouped-by (date, project, context, area)
o merge the notebook tabs into one.

Other
o look at adding braindump to http://pypi.python.org/pypi ?? timrc's suggestion
o decide on consistent coding style
  o widget naming: update, update_btn, etc.
o gut requirements on GNOME, and try to be a pure gtk app by default
  - plugins can have GNOME dependencies
o tickler integration to calendars plus internal notification
o resource tab (basically embedding zim-like functionality)

Default Parent GTD Nodes
o The Task and Proect Views should always display items from the NonePath, and
  perhaps render them in such as way as to indicate to the user that they need to
  update them.

Signals and Slots
o right now the scope is at the GTD tree level, rather than at the individual items.
  There are situations where it might make sense to have the individual widgets listen
  to the individual tree elements (like the context check boxes listening for a context
  rename event, while the context_table needs to listen for Added and Removed contexts)
o work to base all gui updates from updates to the data models.  ie. we shouldn't have to 
  explicitly connect the conext_rename to the context_table.... right?
o look into gobject signals, we may be able to axe the py-notify dependency

GCONF Settings (GNOME dep?)
o window size and position
o details visibility
o last file loaded
o last view state ?

Someday / Maybe
o GWT (Java) for offline web app interface (google gears)
