This is HORRIBLY incomplete.  The list is immense as the project isn't
even completely functional yet.  Right now I just start the app, pick some
unimplemented bit, and hack away...  I'll update this file to remind me
of things I can't just as easily do via inline '# FIXME's

o decide on consistent coding style
  o widget naming: update, update_btn, etc.
o recurring tasks
o task and project resource attachments (with twisty to hide)
o task complete doesn't get immediately updated for the same task
  listed in other categories (but the title does, oddly enough)
o connect task_project combo box to TaskListView
o Add tree sorter functions
o have the filter row animate (swell, glow, whatever) when something is added/removed
