This is HORRIBLY incomplete.  The list is immense as the project isn't
even completely functional yet.  Right now I just start the app, pick some
unimplemented bit, and hack away...  I'll update this file to remind me
of things I can't just as easily do via inline '# FIXME's

o decide on consistent coding style
  o widget naming: update, update_btn, etc.
o Fix gui.py +237 __init__
o call vars gtd_tree instead of gtd
o recurring tasks
o task and project resource attachments (with twisty to hide)
