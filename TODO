This is HORRIBLY incomplete.  The list is immense as the project isn't
even completely functional yet.  Right now I just start the app, pick some
unimplemented bit, and hack away...  I'll update this file to remind me
of things I can't just as easily do via inline '# FIXME's

o decide on consistent coding style
  o widget naming: update, update_btn, etc.
***
o consider eliminating the tree for tasks by context.  Doesn't it make more
  sense to have a column of categories that you can enable or disable, and
  a separate column of tasks which is updated as the context selection changes?
  One advantage here is that the task will only be listed once on the screen,
  saving space, and reducing screen clutter.
***
o recurring tasks
o task and project resource attachments (with twisty to hide)
o task complete doesn't get immediately updated for the same task
  listed in other categories (but the title does, oddly enough)
o connect task_project combo box to TaskTreeView
o Add tree sorter functions
o don't display a checkbutton for categories in the TaskTreeView
